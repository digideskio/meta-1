   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyCQA's Meta Documentation!
======================================

So you're wondering what this "Pie Cee Que Aye" is and you've come here for
answers? You're in luck!

This website is here to provide you with:

- a little bit of the history of the PyCQA

- an idea of who is part of the PyCQA

- how to become a part of the PyCQA

- and other fun things (okay maybe they're not *actually* fun)

Below you'll find the map to this content and anything else we add as we go
along.

| Cheers!
